Derek is a talented designer and strategic problem solver. I enjoyed working with him at Cloud Four on various front-end and design system projects and was consistently impressed by the quality and creativity of his output. Derek consistently produces effective and inclusive interfaces that solve complex problems that prioritize user needs. 

Besides being well-versed in sketching, prototyping, and designing in the browser, he is also a talented front-end developer and a masterful communicator. I would recommend Derek to anyone looking to fill a front-end design or strategic role.
