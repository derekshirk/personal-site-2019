I had the pleasure of working with Derek on a multi-year project and enjoyed our time collaborating together on user interface and design system tasks.

Derek is an excellent listener, patient, and a great teammate. He is open-minded and graceful at giving and receiving feedback. He does an excellent job of striving to design inclusive experiences, asking great cross-disciplinary questions, and making sure the results find technical, functional, and visual harmony.

Having a teammate like Derek made it very easy for me, as a developer, to build more inclusive, well-designed, and thoughtful product design solutions. I highly recommend Derek as he continues forward in his career.
