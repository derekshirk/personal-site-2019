- Looking for a new job 
- Eating plants
- Running
- Reading books about running and food
- Tinkering on this website as much as I can
- Keeping our two new kittens alive and happy while doing my best to teach them not to scratch at our furniture. I'd say, I'm doing a good job at the first two. 
- After 8 years of having an empty [Dribbble account](https://dribbble.com/derekshirk), I'm working on improving my Dribbble game.
